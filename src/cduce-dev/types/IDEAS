- Define a 'widening functions'  (types -> types) such two
  equivalent types become physically equal


- Cache typing derivations, to avoid duplicating work when typing
  invariant parts of overloaded functions. One has to restrict
  the typing environment to the set of free variables for the 
  expression, and compare it to previous typing of this expression;
  if the same environment has been used before, reuse the result.

  Need to benchmark and define heuristics to know when to apply
  this mechanism => empirical.


- Remember compiled regexp when printing; same with XML sugar

- When an arrow constraint is not satisfied when typing a function,
  point to the specific branch ...
  Better: alternate mode of typing << check that this expression
  has at most this type >> 

  DONE


- Convert:  (e1,e2) @ e3   =====>   (e1,e2 @ e3)
  _before_ typing (to better propagate type information downto e1)


- Problem with parser:  keyword and tags may collide ...
  ex: <map>  in XHTML
